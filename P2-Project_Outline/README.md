## Submission Instructions

### Overview
During my time working in insurance, my responsibilities centered around being able to locate an insurance policy or claim for the parties involved in an incident.  It quickly became apparent that there was not a public nor internal resource detailed enough to help identify which policy or claim number belonged to a certain company.  Over time I have put together my own resource to enable me to be more efficient in identifying not only what company I need to be contacting regarding an incident, but also how to contact the company.  Unfortunately my resource is a simplified document that is not easy to share with others.
The application I am putting together, will allow necessary information for a given company to be stored and accessed.  A user will be able to search for a specific company, the pattern of a policy or claim number in order to identify which company they may need to contact, and generate contact information for a person at the other company when a person's name is known.  The final goal of this application will be to move beyond the initial design that is focused towards the insurance industry, and allow any business/industry to specific what information they want to track in order to facilitate more efficient knowledge and communication with other company's within their specific industry.
### Features
A) A database that allows inputting, storing, and editing of companies and individuals
B) A search function; for companies or individuals. Also for patterns; claim/policy number patterns, email/phone patterns.
C) Multi-level users.  General access for anyone whom can view and search the application. Restricted access for users whom can add/edit the information in the database.
D) An email address generator, that will provide an email address for an individual at a company where the company's email pattern is known, with just the individuals name.
E) The ability to open a new email in an external software program (example; Microsoft Outlook), that will auto-fill in any necessary general company email addresses, as well as the address for an individual you are trying to contact.
F) An internal system that will allow any user to submit suggested changes/additions/edits to the database, which will then be shown to users whom have access to add/edit the databases information.
G) The ability to customize what information is gathered so that the application can be utilized in any industry.
### Technologies
A) Java
B) MAMP or alternate database software/hosting
C) Springboot
D) SQL/MySQL?
E) to be determined as needed, to support features as they are developed.

### What I'll Have to Learn
A) May need to learn more in depth regarding user access design
B) How to interface with external software
C) More in depth search function design; having search results show up in real time as search criteria is entered.
D) Best way to send messages between users within an application.
